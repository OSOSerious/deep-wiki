**User Authentication System Specification Document**
================================================================================

**Overview**
-----------

The goal of this project is to design and implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and manage their accounts.

**Requirements Breakdown**
-------------------------

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Registration**:
	* Users must be able to register with a unique username and password.
	* Users must provide a valid email address.
	* The system must validate user input and prevent duplicate usernames and email addresses.
2. **Login**:
	* Users must be able to login with their registered username and password.
	* The system must authenticate users and grant access to authorized resources.
3. **Account Management**:
	* Users must be able to view and update their account information (e.g., email address, password).
	* Users must be able to reset their password.
4. **Session Management**:
	* The system must manage user sessions, including login, logout, and session expiration.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Security**:
	* The system must protect user credentials and sensitive information.
	* The system must prevent common web attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
2. **Performance**:
	* The system must respond to user requests within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 2 seconds).
3. **Usability**:
	* The system must provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for registration, login, and account management.

**Technical Constraints and Considerations**
--------------------------------------------

### Technology Stack

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a JavaScript framework such as React or Angular)
* Backend: Node.js with Express.js or a similar framework
* Database: Relational database management system (e.g., MySQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB)
* Authentication: OAuth 2.0 or a similar authentication protocol

### Security Considerations

* Password hashing and salting
* Secure password storage
* Encryption of sensitive data
* Input validation and sanitization
* Error handling and logging

### Scalability and Performance

* Load balancing and horizontal scaling
* Caching and content delivery networks (CDNs)
* Database optimization and indexing

**Success Criteria**
-------------------

1. **Registration**: Users can successfully register with a unique username and password.
2. **Login**: Users can successfully login with their registered username and password.
3. **Account Management**: Users can view and update their account information.
4. **Security**: The system protects user credentials and sensitive information.
5. **Performance**: The system responds to user requests within a reasonable time frame.

**Risk Analysis**
-----------------

### Security Risks

1. **Password Cracking**: Attackers may attempt to crack user passwords using brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks.
2. **SQL Injection**: Attackers may attempt to inject malicious SQL code to access or modify sensitive data.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Attackers may attempt to inject malicious JavaScript code to steal user credentials or sensitive data.

### Performance Risks

1. **High Traffic**: The system may experience high traffic, leading to slow response times or crashes.
2. **Resource Constraints**: The system may experience resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory), leading to slow response times or crashes.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Implement secure password hashing and salting**.
2. **Use prepared statements and input validation to prevent SQL injection**.
3. **Use output encoding and input validation to prevent XSS**.
4. **Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling to handle high traffic**.
5. **Monitor system resources and optimize database performance**.
