- âœ… Test Generation and Execution

**Observations:**
- The codebase has a moderate average complexity score of 3.20, indicating some areas may be difficult to maintain.
- Test coverage is at 87.5%, which is relatively high but still leaves room for improvement.
- Only 5 issues were found, suggesting the codebase is relatively clean, but 2 test failures indicate potential bugs.
- The number of tests generated is decent, but more tests may be needed to ensure thorough coverage.

**Recommendations:**
- ðŸ”§ Refactor complex code sections to reduce the average complexity score below 3.0 for better maintainability.
- ðŸ”§ Increase test coverage to at least 95% to minimize the risk of undiscovered bugs.
- ðŸ”§ Investigate and resolve the 2 test failures to ensure the codebase is stable.
- ðŸ”§ Consider adding more tests, especially for edge cases and conflict resolution scenarios, to further improve test coverage and reliability.
- ðŸ”§ Implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and ensure consistent quality.
